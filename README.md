# Business Site

I have created a wedding flower business. The website contains a hero image with a navigation, gallery, form and an accordion. It is responsive and has been coded with a mobile-first approach.


## The problem

For this project I used html, css and a tiny bit of JavaScript. I decided that I wanted to make a nice looking accordion so I wanted the icon switch and I also wanted to select my elements with class instead of id to get out of having to repeat myself.
